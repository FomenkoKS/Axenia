# Axenia

## How add bot in my group?
Use link: http://t.me/Axenia_Bot?startgroup=0

Also you can add bot @Axenia_Bot manual.

## 💬 What I can?
Raising/reducing karma
Type 'plus' (+ or 👍) for raising or 'minus' (- or 👎) for reducing karma points to the user on which message it will be replying.
Also I understand messages in format like "+ @username" and etc.

## Commands
/top - show top of users in current group.
/my_stats - show your global statistics.
/settings - open dialog to change the language and to toggle silent-mode which mute bot comments and cooldown time between user's messages about decrease/increase karma points (admin only)
/buy - Also you may buy some content (kitty, gif etc) on your karma points.

Statistics are available on axeniabot.ru.
